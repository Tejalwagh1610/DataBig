# Numerical operators in Python

# + for Addition
# - for Subtraction
# * for multiplication
# / for Division
# // for Integer division
# ** for power calculations
# % for Modulus

# Assignment Operators 
# =, x = 5
# +=, x += 5 -> x = x + 5
# -=, x -= 5 -> x = x - 5
# *=, x *= 5 -> x = x * 5
# /=, x /= 5 -> x = x / 5
# //=, x //= 5 -> x = x // 5
# %=, x %= 5 -> x = x % 5

# Comparision Operators 
# == , Equals to condition, x==y
# != , Not Equals to condition, x!=y
# > , Greater than condition, x<y
# < , Less than condition, x>y
# >= , Greater than Equals to condition, x>=y
# <= , Less than Equals to condition, x<=y
