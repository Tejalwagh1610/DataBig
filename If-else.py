# How to use if-else in Python

x = 10
y = 5

if x==y:
    print("Yes x is equals to y!!")
else:
    print("No, x is not Equals to y!!")

# is it mandetory to use the else block with if block?

# a = 50
# if a==50:
#     print("Yes, a is equals to 50!!")
# print("Bye!!")

a = 40
if a==50:
    print("Yes, a is equals to 50!!")
print("Bye!!")
